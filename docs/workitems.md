## Work Items

### Next Steps
- test documentation
  - document existing test cases in testing.md
  - make a testing plan which includes missing test cases and revisions
- test refactoring
  - make nevessary changes to unit tests according to testing plan
  - consider implementing a testing framework (eg. Jest)

### Technical Debt
- markup and module structure
  - combine debug.html and index.html into one file
  - implement a better module system (ESM modules?)
